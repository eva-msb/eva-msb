          As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into everyday life, it is important to 
          understand how direct interaction with such systems shapes public sentiment toward AI 
          more broadly. Leveraging a unique window in April 2023—when many individuals still had 
          little or no experience with such systems—we combined experimental manipulation 
          (chatbot exposure vs. no exposure) with natural variation in real-world AI usage. 
          In a preregistered proof-of-concept experiment (N= 220), we investigated whether a 
          short conversation with a GPT-3.5-based chatbot influenced participants’ sentiments 
          across multiple dimensions of AI perception. We assessed system-specific fear, user 
          engagement, anthropomorphization, and potential spillover effects to other domains, 
          including AI in medicine, recruitment and governance. Results show that direct interaction 
          reduced fear and increased enjoyment of the chatbot itself, while fostering a more 
          critical, realistic understanding of its abilities. However, spillover effects were 
          limited: exposure led to reduced fear of AI in familiar, concrete domains 
          (eg, medical applications), but not in more abstract or speculative areas. 
          Hope about AI’s societal potential remained unaffected. Our findings highlight 
          that sentiments toward AI are multidimensional and context dependent. Exposure 
          to AI chatbots can shift immediate attitudes but does not necessarily generalize 
          to broader AI perceptions, underscoring the need for more targeted engagement 
          strategies in shaping public understanding and trust.
